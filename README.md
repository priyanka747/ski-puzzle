# Ski-Puzzle
The challenge is to complete the puzzle.
It is indeed a very difficult puzzle and because of that the there are some cool features in the game to help the user out.
You start at the center; 
For the first move you can choose any picture tile you want.
After that the tiles that are potentially the right fit are highlighted to guide the user in their selection. 
The user can also rotate the tile in order to adjust the orientation of it.
You can also remove the tile if you mess up..
